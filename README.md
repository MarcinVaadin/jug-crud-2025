# JUG Demo

This project has been created to show fundamentals of Vaadin at JUG meetings.

This demo contains descriptive code comments and follows [this slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XBjPcaA7LXd1co0XaXfMG-3cg9pgyFRFyZ6wvbvbd-E/edit?usp=sharing).

Please have in mind that this project contains a lot of simplifications and does not follow best coding patterns for sake of demo time limit.
